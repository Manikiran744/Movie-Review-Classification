# Movie-Review-Classification
Implementation of movie review classification using SVMs , Max Entropy Classifier , Logistic Regression ( from scratch )  on unigrams and bigrams

## Algorithms 

I have implemented Logistic Regression from scrath to classify in to either a Positive or Negative review

Extended this approach for bigrams also. 

I have also used SVM , MAX Entropy Classifier ( inbuilt in sklearn )  in predicting the class of a review.

## Accuracy of the model :

On unigrams :

    Logistic Regression  : 84% 

    SVM ( Support Vector Machines ) : 82% 

    Max Entropy Classifier : 84%
 
 On bigrams :
 
      Accuracy of the model : 70%
